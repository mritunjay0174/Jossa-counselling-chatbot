Notes:

Maths Electives should include MA 2010 Complex Variables and Transform Techniques, MA2020 Special Functions and Partial Differential Equations and one other Maths course chosen in consultation with Faculty Advisor.
Electives I to VI from Aero Elective List or other equivalents from other departments with the consent of the Faculty Adviser.
If required by the student area of B.Tech project, a maximum of 2 electives relevant to the project area may be taken for PMT credit eventhough they are not in Aero electives or equivalent thereof.
Students may choose to take up to two of elective I through VI on P/F basis.
Grade for projects assigned in VIII semester. Project is optional. It will be decided based only on the discussion between the student and the faculty guide and upon their mutual concurrence. There will be no CGPA cutoff for project. Those who do not do project shall substitute it with 3 PMT electives including maximum of two from any other Engineering/Physics/Chemistry departments.
Free Electives I & II category will be indicated in the grade card according to the course chosen by the student from own department or from other departments such as MA, HS & PH.
